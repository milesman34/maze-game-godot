I really need to add some sort of obstacles that can hurt the player.
This will make the game more interesting by requiring some aspect of precision, since right now you can only do so much with level design.
Maybe something to shoot projectiles or something like firebars idk.

I need to figure out what collectibles should be saved when you die. Maybe coins could be saved, but not keys.

Maybe for these types of objects I could have them save their previous state
