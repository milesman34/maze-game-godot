Ice that makes the player keep moving in a direction after moving (idk)
Wind?

For the lava level, for room 2 I need to figure out what obstacle to use.
I could set up something that allows for shooting fireballs but invisible (ehhhh)
Or I could have tiles that start safe but become dangerous for some amount of time
Like a glowing lava thing, but how would I implement it?
Maybe I'd have it glow 3 times, then the 4th time it becomes solid lava for a bit, then fades out

Maybe one-way walls?
