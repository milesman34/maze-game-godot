Level browser (so an actual game GUI, store best scores/deaths)
Something that shoots projectiles that harm the player
Conveyor belts that apply a static force to the player in a direction
Ice that makes the player keep moving in a direction after moving (idk)


To implement projectiles properly, I need to make the shooters stop shooting whenever they are off screen, plus I need the projectiles to disappear when off screen, but how would I do this?
Maybe I could have a test for some objects based on the positioning of the camera zone?
