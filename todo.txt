Ice that makes the player keep moving in a direction after moving (idk)
Wind?

For the lava level, for room 2 I need to figure out what obstacle to use.

Maybe one-way walls?

Some sort of tile that becomes dangerous after standing on it for too long (but how to convey this to the player?)

Maybe I should do something to make ICameraZoneListener easier to work with but idk what would work

To add one-way walls, I'll probably want to have a line as the collision, and enable/disable it based on the direction the player is moving.
